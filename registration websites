 feedback/improvements/suggestions are as follows - 

Functionality-
1. Not able to upload the photo and the signiture.
2. We can set the popup forms on the multi form click, like land lord address page.
3. Not able to see the payment getway path. or the button to pay bill.
4. Field validation error functinality isnt working good, some of mandetory field missing from validation and some of the field showing extra validation.
5. Terms and Conditions not working in connection details section.
6. Payment functinality is not working on the Mobile devices, and some others browsers.

Usability-
1. The page UI looks actually good, because of simplicity in the looks, general human can also able read the fields.
2. But it is very tricky to get the navigation after opens the multiple forms.
3. suggest to increas the form field because of that the consumer get confused to see on perticuler form field.
4. lower Require Document section showing some click problems.
5. We can also set the New connection Application on the form.

UI Aesthetics-
1. 'Transmission and Distribution Information Management System' should be in middle of the header container.
2. The banner side could be more attractive than current, shoild not be italic.
3. We can set all the form field should be in a same size, and not depent on the text size.
4. 'view photo here' and 'View Signiture here' implemented wrongly. they are seems broken and signiture field missed out.
5. Billing address status section Yes and No condition should be more attractive, can set the checkbox or radio out if the box.
6. Some of the field text is exact as the field size, we can increase the size of the field.
7. Font size, color and hieght should be consistent as per the section.
8. UI is not the mobile friendly, lots of allignmet design problems are there.
